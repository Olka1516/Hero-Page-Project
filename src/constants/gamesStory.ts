      "The Wild Hunt -- for ages the appearance of this cavalcade of ghostly riders in the night sky has presaged war, plague and death. Few know the riders’ true nature or origin, yet fear grips all at their passing. It is believed they steal souls to add to their ghastly retinue. They come at night, in the cold of winter, and the Aurora Borealis always preceded their appearance.",

    details:
      "Geralt’s mission will require him to make hard choices. Witchers strive to remain neutral, but often find themselves deciding the fate of others. And rarely are these simple choices between good and evil. In this morally gray world, the choices they make can tip the scales of life and death. Wild Hunt features multiple endings that result from choices you make throughout the game. With three extensive epilogues and multiple world end-states in each, the game delivers unmatched replayability.",
