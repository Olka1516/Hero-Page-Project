And rarely are these simple choices between good and evil. In this morally gray world, the choices they make can tip the scales of life and death. Wild Hunt features multiple endings that result from choices you make throughout the game.

Load it with trophies taken from the massive beasts you hunt down or gallop it into combat to crush those standing in your way. You’ll also go where no horse can follow, descending deep into sprawling caves, diving beneath the waves to gather sea herbs and search forgotten shipwrecks for long-lost treasure. You’ll sail your boat through storms, navigate past hostile sea monsters and along craggy, dangerous shores pounded by waves. This land is rich in mystery and adventure -- traverse it any way you like.",

As you traverse distinct regions, you’ll feel and see the world change. You’ll hear the change on people’s lips, too: in Skellige battle-hardened marauders will shout boasts of their latest raids, in Toussaint, knights errant use colorful expressions evoking the prestige of their royal roles, while in No Man’s Land, villagers will pray in hushed whispers to dark, ancient gods.",

In your search for information you’ll make unsavory deals with criminals, attend balls with the high-born and listen to the heart-wrenching tales of war refugees. All around you will see signs of gross injustice, wartime atrocities and more -- but it’s always up to you to either help or shrug and let the fires rage. The Continent is also a living, wild world: you’ll interact with animals both hostile and benign and witness a true ecosystem with natural checks and balances in action. And in this system, you’ll be the apex predator. Clear out the monsters infesting a region, or eradicate a nest to rid an area of the foul beasts it spawns, and watch residents return to rebuild their lives. In The Witcher, the world lives alongside you and resonates with your every action.",

Witcher’s Signs, another set of skills in Geralt’s repertoire, are powerful combat spells that take various forms, from protective barriers, through torrents of flame, to magic snares and more. Lastly there is Geralt’s wolf medallion, the symbol of his witcher school. This pendant hums to alert him of nearby magic and monsters -- invaluable help to a monster hunter. Most of these skills can be developed for additional effects and increased potency, making Geralt an even more fearsome fighter.",

His main task is to eliminate creatures that pose a threat to society. Hunting monsters is his business -- and there’s always plenty of work. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes, and while some are members of broader species, others are one -of-a-kind. To face the latter, extremely powerful or clever creatures, you’ll embark on special quests to learn about their fighting style and behavior. The monster threat is real and strong. Along your path you’ll encounter entire areas overrun by beasts, the humans and nonhumans who once lived there gone. Should you decide to risk death, your job will be to exterminate every last pest and render these places safe once more. Succeed and you’ll see folk return, more than eager to craft and sell you rare, enhanced gear.",

The wide variety of armor available to Geralt absorbs both physical and magical attacks, thereby delaying the witcher’s own demise, while potent blade oils and bombs give him an extra edge in combat. Thanks to his training in alchemy, Geralt can gather rare herbs along his path and use them to brew special, highly toxic concoctions. His potions would kill any ordinary human, but Geralt’s mutations let him metabolize them. They grant him abilities that include seeing in the dark, moving faster, striking with added force… and much, much more.",

Those with different agendas send their spies, assassins, murderers and thugs after him. Since the forces of order generally don’t like witchers, you won’t be able to count on guards or soldiers coming to your aid. You’re on your own -- and in for a tough fight.",
